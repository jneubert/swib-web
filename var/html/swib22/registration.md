# Registration

This year's SWIB will be held on the web, without a participation fee.  Plenary
and face-to-face discussions as well as group meetings will take place in the
open source messaging platform Mattermost. Presentations will be streamed live,
workshops will be held with BigBlueButton (BBB).

SWIB22 Mattermost is open from now on until the end of December. Within
Mattermost, you will be able to chat or start BBB video calls with other
participants, or to come together in topic-specific groups and organize
breakout sessions.

Participation is free of charge. Please use our ConfTool system to register now
for this year's conference, and optionally for a workshop. Your Mattermost
account will be created automatically, and you will receive an email with the
login details.
