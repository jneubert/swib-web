<h2 id="artem-reshetnikov">Artem Reshetnikov</h2>
<p>Artem is a deep learning researcher at Barcelona Supercomputing Center. Being a researcher he received big experience in Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing and applying it to his work. All of his life he was curious about history and art and finished some online courses. For a long time, he was thinking about how to join his two main passions: machine learning and art. The solution is the project where he works now. Saint George on a Bike is a project about the enrichment of metadata of paintings using Deep Learning and NLP approaches. His current area of interest is the intersection of NLP and Deep Learning and applying semantic metadata for improving object detection and caption generation. He graduated from the Autonomous University of Barcelona in 2019 with a Master’s Degree in Engineering. Before he worked for several commercial projects focused on Data Analysis, Computer Vision, and Anomaly detection in marketing and retails in such companies as Indra or Tecnocom in Spain. The projects mainly were based on the idea of applying deep learning in traffic counting using Computer Vision, analysis of time series data for anomaly behavior of clients.</p>

<p>Lozana Rossenova (PhD, London South Bank University, UK) is a digital designer and researcher based in Berlin. In 2021, she completed a PhD degree at the Centre for the Study of the Networked Image in collaboration with Rhizome, a leading international born-digital art organization. Her research focused on questions related to data presentation and performativity in Linked Open Data environments. Rossenova is particularly interested in open source and community-driven approaches to digital infrastructure and archive design. She is an active member of the Wikidata and Wikibase open source development communities, and a Steering Committee member of OpenRefine, an open source data management tool with wide adoption in heritage, research and digital humanities communities. Currently she works as a Postdoc Researcher at the Open Science Lab in TIB Hannover, working on the NFDI4Culture project for a national research infrastructure of cultural heritage data.</p>

Steffen is especially interested in open web technologies. He tries to solves problems concerning heterogenous education metadata with the help of semantic web approaches. Steffen is also contributing to the open source project <a href="https://github.com/skohub-io/skohub-vocabs">SkoHub-Vocabs</a>, a lightweight tool for publishing SKOS vocabularies with a HTML view and at the same time in a machine-readable format. Together with Adrian Pohl he will conduct a workshop for it. He is also researching on machine-readable curricula and framework data, so if this is also of interest for you (or any other topic mentioned), feel free to reach out!</p>

<p>Daniel is an associate librarian at Laurentian University in Canada. His research focuses on the intersection of linked data and libraries. He helped develop the Bibliographic Extensions for schema.org and implemented schema.org in the default Evergreen, Koha, and VuFind web UIs. With Stacy Allison-Cassin, Daniel was an early advocate for the adoption of Wikidata by libraries as a read-write linked data store, and he customized Evergreen to dynamically incorporate musician data from Wikidata into its detailed record display. Most recently, he helped assess the readiness for and understanding of BIBFRAME by Canadian librarians (short answer: not ready, very little understanding).</p>
