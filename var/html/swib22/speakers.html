<h2 id="artem-reshetnikov">Artem Reshetnikov</h2>
<p>Artem is a deep learning researcher at Barcelona Supercomputing Center. Being a researcher he received big experience in Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing and applying it to his work. All of his life he was curious about history and art and finished some online courses. For a long time, he was thinking about how to join his two main passions: machine learning and art. The solution is the project where he works now. Saint George on a Bike is a project about the enrichment of metadata of paintings using Deep Learning and NLP approaches. His current area of interest is the intersection of NLP and Deep Learning and applying semantic metadata for improving object detection and caption generation. He graduated from the Autonomous University of Barcelona in 2019 with a Master’s Degree in Engineering. Before he worked for several commercial projects focused on Data Analysis, Computer Vision, and Anomaly detection in marketing and retails in such companies as Indra or Tecnocom in Spain. The projects mainly were based on the idea of applying deep learning in traffic counting using Computer Vision, analysis of time series data for anomaly behavior of clients.</p>
