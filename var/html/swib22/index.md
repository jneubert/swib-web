# SWIB22 – 14th Semantic Web in Libraries Conference

## ... took place from 28.11. to 02.12.2022 (online)




SWIB conference (Semantic Web in Libraries) is an annual conference, being held
for the 14th time.

Due to the Covid-19 pandemic, we cannot be sure that by November travelling and
meeting face-to-face will be possible for everybody in the community.
Therefore, we have decided to hold SWIB22 online for the third time.  This will
offer everybody an opportunity to easily participate from all over the world.

Taking into account the different time zones of the participants, we plan to
carry out the conference during the week of 28 November – 02 December, daily
from UTC 14:00 to 16:30.

SWIB focuses on Linked Open Data (LOD) in libraries and related organizations.
It is well established as an event where IT staff, developers, librarians, and
researchers from all over the world meet and mingle and learn from each other.
The topics of talks and workshops at SWIB revolve around opening data, linking
data and creating tools and software for LOD production scenarios. These areas
of focus are supplemented by presentations of research projects in applied
sciences, industry applications, and LOD activities in other areas.

As usual, SWIB22 will be organized by **[ZBW – Leibniz Information Centre for
Economics](https://www.zbw.eu/en)** and the **[North Rhine-Westphalian Library
Service Centre (hbz)](https://www.hbz-nrw.de/)**. The conference language is
English.
