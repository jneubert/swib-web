<h1>SWIB Code of Conduct</h1>





<p>We want to enable participation and inclusion and reflect our principle of equality and diversity. All attendees, speakers, conference staff and volunteers at our conference are required to agree with the following Code of Conduct. Organisers will enforce this CoC throughout the event. We expect cooperation from all participants to help ensure a safe, respectful and productive environment in which everyone feels welcome.</p>

<p>With your registration and your commitment to participate at SWIB Conference, you agree with the following Code of Conduct.</p>
	
	<h2>The Short Version</h2>

<p>Our conference is dedicated to providing a harassment- and discrimination-free conference experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, ethnic background, religion or belief (or lack thereof), social background, or technology choices. We do not tolerate threatening behaviour, violence or any type of harassment of conference participants. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any conference venue, including talks, workshops, social events, Twitter and other online media.</p>

<p>Conference participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the conference without a refund at the discretion of the conference organisers.</p>
	
	<h2>The Less Short Version</h2>

<p>Harassment includes, but is not limited to, offensive verbal comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, ethnic background, religion or belief, social background, technology choices, sexual images in public spaces, engagement in sexual activities like deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.</p>

<p>Participants asked to stop any violent or harassing behaviour are expected to comply immediately.</p>

<p>SWIB Conference organisers and staff are also subject to the anti-harassment policy. We do not support or use sexualised and other discriminatory images, activities, material or attitudes.</p>

<p>If a participant engages in harassing behaviour, the conference organisers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the conference with no refund.</p>

<p>If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed or have any other concerns, please contact a member of conference staff immediately. Conference staff will be happy to help participants by providing information, contacting a hotel or taxi, alerting local law enforcement, or otherwise assisting those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of the conference. We value your attendance.</p>
